Write out all the steps necessary for your mini-capstone backend to allow users to purchase multiple products with a shopping cart. (aim for roughly 10 to 15 steps)

*Testing after each step*
1.) create model for carted_products 
  -  in carted_product model include attr product_id, user_id, quantity, order_id, status
2.) remove product_id & quantity attribute from orders model
3.) Update/create associations to include carted_products
4.) Create carted_products route/controller
5.) controller actions for carted_products: create, update, index (all history of carted_product vs. all carted_product for current order) (w/login)
